# A Timeline Full of Gaps | True Crime Script
## IntroductionInvestigators often say the truth lives in the timeline.  But what happens when the timeline itself doesn’t make sense?
This case is defined not by what we know—but by what’s missing.
---
## Timeline: The Final Day
### MorningThe individual followed their normal routine.  Phone records and witnesses confirmed nothing unusual during the early hours.
### AfternoonSeveral routine messages were sent.  No signs of distress. No plans to leave town.
Everything appeared normal.
---
### EveningThis is where the timeline becomes unclear.
The person was last confirmed at a public location shortly before sunset.  After that, all verified activity stops.
No confirmed sightings.  No confirmed communication.
---
## The Critical GapBetween evening and early morning, there is a complete absence of data.
- No phone usage  - No card transactions  - No verified witnesses  
Investigators believe this window holds the key to the entire case.
---
## Attempts to Reconstruct EventsAuthorities analyzed:- Security footage  - Traffic data  - Statements from people nearby  
But without a single confirmed event, the timeline remains fragmented.
---
## Why the Timeline MattersIn many cases, one small confirmed action can unlock the truth.
A message.  A camera angle.  A forgotten detail.
Here, none were found.
---
## ClosingA timeline with gaps is more than incomplete—it’s dangerous.
Because without answers, theories replace facts.  And the truth drifts further away with time.
This case remains open, waiting for one moment to finally make sense.
